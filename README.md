# Module 04 Challenge - School District Analysis

## Project Overview

We were provided with two original source data files from the School Board, as shown below in [Resources](https://github.com/TPapiernik/Module_04_Challenge#resources)

### DISCLAIMER
|At the outset, it should be noted that the School Board has identified that reading and math grades may have been altered for 9th Grade Students at Thomas High School. At this time, the School Board does not know the full extend or nature of the academic dishonesty, but it certainly casts a cloud over this analysis project.|
|-

Therefore, the purpose of this analysis was threefold:
1. Calculate summary statistics for the entire school district, and report them in a variety of formats.
2. Exclude all Thomas High School 9th Grade Reading and Math Grades, re-run the analysis, and determine how these changes affected the overall district-level results.
3. Provide commentary and insight for Items 1. and 2. above.
